Alex exudes an intelligence and resourcefulness that is far beyond his years. He is extremely motivated and driven and would be a valuable asset to any organization he is a part of. His work ethic is unrivaled by his peers, a valuable skill that cannot be taught, but rather developed over a lifetime of hard work. Perhaps the most impressive thing about Alex is his ability to think on his feet in the face of adversity, a skill that is uncommon among members of his generation. Alex is a young superstar in the making and I highly recommend him for any opportunity that he seeks to pursue. I have had the pleasure of knowing Alex since he was a teenager.
